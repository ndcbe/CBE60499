    "The **primary purpose** of this assignment is to give you **hands-on-keyboard experience** with optimization modeling and analysis. In this assignment, I incorporated many of the best practices I share with my Ph.D. students during their first year using Pyomo for research. Specifically:\n",
    "* Planning is the most important (and often most overlooked step) in computer programming. Two best practices are to (1) write pseudocode and (2) write the optimization model on paper and perform degree of freedom analysis before you use the computer. We practiced tip (2) in class. If you cannot do (1) and (2), no amount of Googling Pyomo/Python syntax will save you.\n",
    "* Functions (or classes) allow us to reuse most of our code. Below I gave you function definitions and doc strings to show you a good way to \"modularize\" this analysis. Once the functions defined below work, performing the analysis is easy.\n",
    "* Solving your optimization problem a few times is (often) not a sufficient research result. Who cares? Application-driven research is all about the analysis. Optimization is a tool to better answer analysis questions. By giving you >50% of the code for this assignment, I am intentionally emphasizing the analysis (not just coding).  You will see we can take a really simple optimization model and ask/answer some interesting analysis questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start this assignment early. Almost everyone will make at least one Python/Pyomo syntax mistake. Give yourself plenty of time to ask questions on Slack. Please also be generous with helping your classmates. This assignment (and grades in general in this class) is not a competition. You are welcome (encouraged!) to post screenshots of your code in Slack when asking/answering questions. Please refrain from posting your discussion responses. You are welcome to discuss the analysis questions on Slack; everyone should answer the discussion questions in their own words."
